Description: Various clustering algorithms that produce a credal partition,
    i.e., a set of Dempster-Shafer mass functions representing the membership of objects
    to clusters. The mass functions quantify the cluster-membership uncertainty of the     
    objects. The algorithms are: Evidential c-Means, Relational Evidential c-Means, 
    Constrained Evidential c-Means, Evidential Clustering, Constrained Evidential 
    Clustering, Evidential K-nearest-neighbor-based Clustering, Bootstrap Model-Based
    Evidential Clustering, Belief Peak Evidential Clustering, Neural-Network-based
    Evidential Clustering.
