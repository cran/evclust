Description: Various clustering algorithms that produce a credal partition,
    i.e., a set of Dempster-Shafer mass functions representing the membership of objects
    to clusters. The mass functions quantify the cluster-membership uncertainty of the objects.
    The algorithms are: Evidential c-Means (ECM), Relational Evidential c-Means (RECM),
    Constrained Evidential c-Means (CECM), EVCLUS, EK-NNclus and bootclus.
Depends: R (>= 3.6.0),
