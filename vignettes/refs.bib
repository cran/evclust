   abstract = {Clustering is the partitioning of a set of objects into groups (clusters) so that objects within a group are more similar to each others than objects in different groups. Most of the clustering algorithms depend on some assumptions in order to define the subgroups present in a data set. As a consequence, the resulting clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity.
The evaluation procedure has to tackle difficult problems such as the quality of clusters, the degree with which a clustering scheme fits a specific data set and the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning. In the literature, a wide variety of indices have been proposed to find the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning of a data set during the clustering process. However, for most of indices proposed in the literature, programs are unavailable to test these indices and compare them.
The R package NbClust has been developed for that purpose. It provides 30 indices which determine the number of clusters in a data set and it offers also the best clustering scheme from different results to the user. In addition, it provides a function to perform k-means and hierarchical clustering with different distance measures and aggregation methods. Any combination of validation indices and clustering methods can be requested in a single function call. This enables the user to simultaneously evaluate several clustering schemes while varying the number of clusters, to help determining the most appropriate number of clusters for the data set of interest.},

   abstract = {The R package clValid contains functions for validating the results of a clustering analysis.  There are three main types of cluster validation measures available, \"internal\", \"stability\", and \"biological\".  The user can choose from nine clustering algorithms in existing R packages, including hierarchical, K-means, self-organizing maps (SOM), and model-based clustering.  In addition, we provide a function to perform the self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) method of clustering.  Any combination of validation measures and clustering methods can be requested in a single function call.  This allows the user to simultaneously evaluate several clustering algorithms while varying the number of clusters, to help determine the most appropriate method and number of clusters for the dataset of interest.  Additionally, the package can automatically make use of the biological information contained in the Gene Ontology (GO) database to calculate the biological validation measures, via the annotation packages available in Bioconductor. The function returns an object of S4 class \"clValid\", which has summary, plot, print, and additional methods which allow the user to display the optimal validation scores and extract clustering results.},

   abstract = {Witten and Tibshirani (2010) proposed an algorithim to simultaneously find clusters and select clustering variables, called sparse K-means (SK-means). SK-means is particularly useful when the dataset has a large fraction of noise variables (that is, variables without useful information to separate the clusters). SK-means works very well on clean and complete data but cannot handle outliers nor missing data. To remedy these problems we introduce a new robust and sparse K-means clustering algorithm implemented in the R package RSKC. We demonstrate the use of our package on four datasets. We also conduct a Monte Carlo study to compare the performances of RSK-means and SK-means regarding the selection of important variables and identification of clusters. Our simulation study shows that RSK-means performs well on clean data and better than SK-means and other competitors on outlier-contaminated data.},
